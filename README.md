# Coronavirus Data Parser

(LAST UPDATE MAY 3)

This is a program I wrote to parse Coronavirus statistics from https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data . 
My goal was to rank total cases by country or continent, rank total new cases by country and continent, and to rank the countries that needed testing the most.
